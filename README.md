## Run test docker image
Please don't use this build for production, as it uses debug ssl certificate, lacks a few features and all files are located inside of container, meaning you will lose all data on container destroy.

 - Download and run image: 
 ```bash
 docker run -tp 443:443 deathangel908/pychat-test
 ```
 - Open [https://localhost](https://localhost)

## Run prod docker image

 - You need create ssl certificates: `server.key` and `certificate.crt`. For example 
```bash
openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout server.key -out certificate.crt -days 3650
```
 - Download [settings.py](https://github.com/akoidan/pychat/blob/master/chat/settings_example.py) and edit it according comments in it.
 - Download [production.json](https://github.com/akoidan/pychat/blob/master/docker/pychat.org/production.json)  and edit it according [wiki](https://github.com/akoidan/pychat#frontend-config)
 - Create volume and copy files there
 ```bash
 docker volume create pychat_data
 containerid=`docker container create --name dummy -v pychat_data:/data hello-world`
 docker cp settings.py dummy:/data/settings.py
 docker cp production.json dummy:/data/production.json
 docker cp certificate.crt dummy:/data/certificate.crt
 docker cp server.key dummy:/data/server.key
 docker rm dummy
 ```
 If you need to edit files inside container you can use 
 ```bash
docker run -i -t -v pychat_data:/tmp -it alpine /bin/sh
```
 - Run image with:
```bash
docker run -t -v pychat_data:/data -p 443:443 deathangel908/pychat
```
 - Open [https://localhost](https://localhost) and enjoy it!

## Native setup
If you don't or unable to run docker you can alway do the setup w/o it. You definitely spend more time, so I would recommend to use docker if possible. But if you're still sure,  here's the setup for cent-os/archlinux based system:
 
 - For production I would recommend to clone repository to `/srv/http/pychat`.  If you want to close the project into a different directory, replace all absolute paths in config files. You can use `download_content.sh rename_root_directory` to do that.
 - For archlinux follow [Install OS packages](#install-os-packages), add add these ones: `pacman -S postfix gcc jansson`. 
 - For centos use add `alias yum="python2 $(which yum)"` to /etc/bashrc if you use python3. And then install that packages `yum install python34u, python34u-pip, redis, mysql-server, mysql-devel, postfix, mailx`
  - If you want to use native file-uploader (nginx_upload_module written in `C`) instead of python uploader (which is a lot slower) you should build nginx yourself. For archlinux setup requires `pacman -S python-lxml gd make geoip`. To build nginx with this module run from the root user: `bash download_content.sh build_nginx 1.15.3 2.3.0`. And create dir + user `useradd nginx; install -d -m 0500 -o http -g http /var/cache/nginx/`. If you don't, just install nginx with your package manager: `pacman -S nginx` or `yum install nginx`
 - Follow [Bootstrap files](#bootstrap-files) flow.
 - I preconfigued native setup for domain `pychat.org`, you want to replace all occurrences of `pychat.org` in [rootfs](rootfs) directory for your domain. To simplify replacing use my script: `./download_content.sh rename_domain your.new.domain.com`. Also check `rootfs/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/pychat.conf` if `server_name` section is correct after renaming.
 - HTTPS is required for webrtc calls so you need to enable ssl:
   - Either create your certificates and put according to [pychat.conf](rootfs/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/pychat.conf) ssl_certificate/ssl_certificate_key.
   - Either use something like [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/arch-nginx)
 - Copy config files to rootfs with  `sh download_content.sh copy_root_fs`.
 - Don't forget to change the owner of current (project) directory to `http` user: `chown -R http:http`. And reload systemd config `systemctl daemon-reload`.
 - Generate postfix files: `install -d -m 0555 -o postfix -g postfix /etc/postfix/virtual; postmap /etc/postfix/virtual; newaliases; touch /etc/postfix/virtual-regexp; echo 'root postmaster' > /etc/aliases`
 - For archlinux start this services: `packages=( mysqld  redis systemctl tornado@8888 nginx postfix ) ; for package in "${packages[@]}" ; do systemctl enable $package; done;`
 - For centos start that services: `packages=( redis-server  nginx postfix mysqld tornado@8888) ; for package in "${packages[@]}" ; do service $package start; done;`
 - If you want to enable autostart (after reboot) for archlinux: `packages=( redis  nginx postfix mysqld tornado) ; for package in "${packages[@]}" ; do systemctl start $package; done;`
 - If you want to enable autostart (after reboot) for centos: `chkconfig mysqld on; chkconfig on; chkconfig tornado on; chkconfig redis on; chkconfig postfix on`
 - Follow the [Frontend](#frontend) steps
 - Open in browser [http**s**://your.domain.com](https://127.0.0.1). Note that by default nginx accepts request by domain.name rather than ip.
 - If something doesn't work you want to check `pychat/logs` directory. If there's no logs in directory you may want to check service stdout: `sudo journalctl -u YOUR_SERVICE`. Check that user `http` has access to you project directory.

## Frontend
 - `cd fe; nvm use 12.10`
 - `yarn install`
 - Create production.json based on [Frontend config](#frontend-config)
 - Run `yarn run prod`. This generates static files in `fe/dist` directory.

## Desktop app
Pychat uses websql and built the way so it renders everything possible w/o network. You have 2 options:

### Natifier
Use [nativifier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier#installation) to create a client (replace pychat.org for your server): `npx run nativifier pychat.org`

### Electron
 - Create production.json based on [Frontend config](#frontend-config)
 - Run `cd fe; yarn run electronProd`.

## Android app
This is harsh. If you're not familiar with android SDK I would recommend doing the steps below from AndroidStudio:
 - Install android sdk, android platform tools. accept license
 - Create production.json based on [Frontend config](#frontend-config)
 - `bash download_content.sh android`

# Development setup

The flow is the following
 - Install OS packages depending on your OS type
 - Bootstrap files
 - Follow the [Frontend](#frontend) steps
 - Start services and check if it works

## Install OS packages
This section depends on the OS you use. I tested full install on Windows/Ubuntu/CentOs/MacOS/Archlinux/Archlinux(rpi3 armv7). [pychat.org](https://pychat.org) currently runs on Archlinux Raspberry Pi 3.

### [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/windows.aspx):
 1. Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with pip. only **Python 3.6-3.8** is supported.
 2. Add **pip** and **python** to `PATH` variable.
 3. Install [redis](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis/releases). Get the newest version or at least 2.8.
 5. Install [mysql](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/). You basically need mysql server and python connector.
 6. You also need to install python's **mysqlclient**. If you want to compile one yourself you need to **vs2015** tools. You can download [visual-studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx) and install [Common Tools for Visual C++ 2015](http://i.stack.imgur.com/J1aet.png). You need to run setup as administrator. The only connector can be found [here](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/). The wheel (already compiled) connectors can be also found here [Mysqlclient](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#mysqlclient). Use `pip` to install them.
 7. Add bash commands to `PATH` variable. **Cygwin** or **git's** will do find.(for example if you use only git **PATH=**`C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin;C:\Program Files\Git\bin`).

### [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/):
 1. Install required packages: `apt-get install python pip mysql-server` (python should be 3.6-3.8) If pip is missing check `python-pip`.
 2. Install **redis** database: `add-apt-repository -y ppa:rwky/redis; apt-get install -y redis-server`

### [Archlinux](https://www.archlinux.org/):
 1. Install system packages:  `pacman -S unzip python python-pip redis mariadb python-mysqlclient nvm`.
 2. If you just installed mariadb you need to initialize it: `mysql_install_db --user=mysql --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql`.
 
### [MacOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS)
 1. Install packages: `brew install mysql redis python3` 
 1. Start services `brew services run mysql redis`
 2. Install mysqlclient `pip install mysqlclient`

## Bootstrap files:
 1. I use 2 git repos in 2 project directory. So you probably need to rename `excludeMAIN`file to `.gitignore`or create link to exclude. `ln -rsf .excludeMAIN .git/info/exclude`
 2. Rename [chat/settings_example.py](chat/settings_example.py) to `chat/settings.py`. **Modify file according to the comments in it.**
 3. Create virtualEnv `python3 -m venv --system-site-packages .venv` and activate it: `source .venv/bin/activate`
 4. Install python packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
 5. From root user create the database: `echo "create database pychat CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci; CREATE USER 'pychat'@'localhost' identified by 'pypass'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pychat.* TO 'pychat'@'localhost';" | mysql -u root`.  If you also need remote access do the same with `'192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0';`
 6. Fill database with tables: `bash download_content.sh create_django_tables`

## Follow the [Frontend](#frontend) steps

## Configure IDEs if you use it:

### Pycharm
 1. Enable django support. Go to Settings -> Django -> Enable django support. 
   - Django project root: root directory of your project. Where .git asides.
   - Put `Settings:` to `chat/settings.py`
 2. `Settings` -> `Project pychat` -> `Project Interpreter` -> `Cogs in right top` -> 'Add' -> `Virtual Environment` -> `Existing environment` -> `Interpereter` = `pychatdir/.venv/bin/python`. Click ok. In previous menu on top 'Project interpreter` select the interpriter you just added.
 3. `Settings` -> `Project: pychat` -> `Project structure`
  - You might want to exclude: `.idea`
  - mark `templates` directory as `Template Folder`
 4. Add tornado script: `Run` -> `Edit configuration` ->  `Django server` -> Checkbox `Custom run command` `start_tornado`. Remove port value.
 
## Linting
 - atm frontend linting is only available, so `cd fe`
 - https://eslint.vuejs.org/rules/this-in-template.html
 
Current linting supports:

 - Sass is linted with [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules) configured with [.stylelintrc](fe/.stylelintrc)
 - Typescript are linted with eslint, along with .vue files [eslint-plugin-vue](https://eslint.vuejs.org/rules/this-in-template.html) configured with [.eslintrc.json](fe/.eslintrc.json)

### Webstorm
 
#### Set template
 1. New
 2. Edit files templates...
 3. Vue single file component

```vue
<template>
    <div>#[[$END$]]#</div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
  import {State} from '@/utils/store';
  import {Component, Prop, Vue, Watch, Ref} from 'vue-property-decorator';

  @Component
  export default class ${COMPONENT_NAME} extends Vue {
   
  }
</script>
<style lang="sass" scoped>

</style>
```

#### Change linting settings

Disable tslint, since it's not used, and enable eslint:

 1. Settings
 2. Typescript
 3. Tslint
 4. Disable tslint

 
#### Enable aliases for webpack
 - to resolve absolute path for webpack webstorm requires webpack.config.js. Go to settings -> javascript -> webpack -> Webpack config file  

## Build frontend
I would recommend to use version node 12.10, `nvm use 12.10`. You can install nvm with [archlinux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Node.js_) [ubuntu](https://qiita.com/shaching/items/6e398140432d4133c866) [windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows). 
 - To get started install dependencies first: `yarn install` # or use npm if you're old and cranky
 - Take a look at copy [development.json](fe/development.json]`. The description is at [Frontend config](#frontend-config)
 - Webpack-dev-server is used for development purposes with hot reloading, every time you save the file it will automatically apply. This doesn't affect node running files, only watching files. So files like builder.js or development.json aren't affected. Take a look at [development.json](development.json). To run dev-server use `yarn run dev`. You can navigate to http://localhost:8080
 - To build android use `yarn run android -- 192.168.1.55` where 55 is your bridge ip address
 - To run electron use `yarn run electronDev`. This will start electron dev. and generate `/tmp/electron.html` and `/tmp/electron.js` 
  

## Start services and run:
 - Start `mysql` server if it's not started.
 - Start session holder: `redis-server`
 - Start webSocket listener: `python manage.py start_tornado`
 - Open in browser [http**s**://127.0.0.1:8080](https://127.0.0.1:8080).
 - Add self signed ssl certificate provided by [django-sslserver](https://github.com/teddziuba/django-sslserver/blob/master/sslserver/certs/development.crt) to browser exception. For chrome you can enable invalid certificates for localohost in [chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost](chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost). Or for others open [https://localhost:8888](https://localhost:8888) and [https://localhost:8000](https://localhost:8000). Where `8888` comes from `start_tornado.py`

# Contribution guide

## Description
Pychat is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). For handling realtime messages [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) are used: browser support on client part and asynchronous framework [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/) on server part. For ORM [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) was used with [MySql](https://www.mysql.com/) backend. Messages are being broadcast by means of [redis](http://redis.io/) [pub/sub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) feature using [tornado-redis](https://github.com/leporo/tornado-redis) backend. Redis is also used as django session backend and for storing current users online. For video call [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) technology was used with stun server to make a connection, which means you will always get the lowest ping and the best possible connection channel. Client part is written with progressive js framework [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/) which means that pychat is SPA, so even if user navigates across different pages websocket connection doesn't break. Pychat also supports OAuth2 login standard via FaceBook/Google. Css is compiled from [sass](http://sass-lang.com/guide). Server side can be run on any platform **Windows**, **Linux**, **Mac**. Client (users) can use Pychat from any browser with websocket support: IE11, Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Android, Opera, Safari...

## Shell helper
Execute `bash download_content.sh` it will show you help.

## Frontend logging
By default each user has turned off browser (console) logs. You can turn them on in [/#/profile](https://localhost:8000/#/profile) page (`logs` checkbox). All logs are logged with `window.logger` object, for ex: `window.logger('message')()`. Note that logger returns a function which is binded to params, that kind of binding shows corrent lines in browser, especially it's handy when all source comes w/o libraries/webpack or other things that transpiles or overhead it. You can also inspect ws messages [here](ws_messages.jpeg) for chromium. You can play with `window.wsHandler.handleMessage(object)` and `window.wsHandler.handle(string)` methods in debug with messages from log to see what's going on

## Icons
Chat uses [fontello](fontello.com) and its api for icons. The decision is based on requirements for different icons that come from different fonts and ability to add custom assets. Thus the fonts should be generated (`.wolf` etc). W/o this chat would need to download a lot of different fonts which would slow down the loading process. You can easily edit fonts via your browser, just execute `bash download_content.sh post_fontello_conf`. Make your changes and hit "Save session". Then execute `bash download_content.sh download_fontello`. If you did everything right new icons should appear under [fe/src/assets/demo.html](fe/src/assets/demo.html)

## Sustaining online protocol
Server pings clients every PING_INTERVAL miliseconds. If client doesn't respond with pong in PING_CLOSE_JS_DELAY, server closes the connection. If ther're multiple tornado processes if can specify port for main process with MAIN_TORNADO_PROCESS_PORT. In turn the client expects to be pinged by the server, if client doesn't receive ping event it will close the connection as well. As well page has window listens for focus and sends ping event when it receives it, this is handy for situation when pc suspends from ram.

## Database migrations
Pychat uses standard [django migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/migrations/) tools. So if you updated your branch from my repository and database has changed you need to `./manage.py makemigration` and  `./manage.py migrate`. If automatic migration didn't work I also store migrations in [migration](migrations).  So you might take a look if required migration is there before executing commands. If you found required migration in my repo don't forget to change `Migration.dependencies[]` and rename the file.

## Screen sharing for Chrome v71 or less
ScreenShare available for Chrome starting from v71. For chrome v31+ you should install an extension. It uses `chrome.desktopCapture` feature that is available only via extension. The extension folder is located under [screen_cast_extension](screen_cast_extension)`.
If you want to locally test it:

 - Open `chrome://extensions/` url in chrome and verify that `developer mode` checkbox is checked.
 - In the same tab click on `load unpacked extension...` button and select [screen_cast_extension](screen_cast_extension) directory.
 - Note that in order to `background.js` be able to receive messages from webpage you need to add your host to `externally_connectable` section in  [manifest.json](screen_cast_extension/manifest.json)

Tp publish extension:
 - If you want to update existing extension don't forget to increment `version` in [manifest.json](package/manifest.json).
 - Zip [screen_cast_extension](screen_cast_extension) directory into e.g. `bash download_content.sh zip_extension`
 - Upload archive `extension.zip` to [chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard) (Note, you need to have a developer account, that's 5$ worth atm).

## WebRTC connection establishment
The successful connection produces logs below in console

Sender:
```
rsok33GN CallHandler initialized
rsok33GN:0005:EJAd Created CallSenderPeerConnection
rsok33GN:0005:EJAd Creating RTCPeerConnection
rsok33GN:0005:EJAd Creating offer...
rsok33GN:0005:EJAd Created offer, setting local description
rsok33GN:0005:EJAd Sending offer to remote
rsok33GN:0005:EJAd onsendRtcData
rsok33GN:0005:EJAd answer received
rsok33GN:0005:EJAd onaddstream
rsok33GN:0005:EJAd onsendRtcData
```

Receiver:
```
rsok33GN CallHandler initialized
rsok33GN:0004:oIc5 Created CallReceiverPeerConnection
rsok33GN:0004:oIc5 Creating RTCPeerConnection
rsok33GN:0004:oIc5 onsendRtcData
rsok33GN:0004:oIc5 Creating answer
rsok33GN:0004:oIc5 onaddstream
rsok33GN:0004:oIc5 Sending answer
rsok33GN:0004:oIc5 onsendRtcData
rsok33GN:0004:oIc5 onsendRtcData
```

The string `rsok33GN:0005:EJAd` describes:
 - `rsok33GN` is ID of CallHandler
 - `0005` is Id of user
 - `EJAd` id of connection (`TornadoHandler.id`)
 
## Frontend Stack
The technologies stack used in project:
- Typescript
- Vue, Vuex, VueRouter, lines-logger
- Vuex-module-decorators, Vue-property-decorator
- Webpack and loaders
- Sass

[builder.js](fe/builder.js) is used to build project. Take a look at it to understand how source files are being processed. Its start point is `entry: ['./src/main.ts']`. Everything is imported in this files are being processed by section `loaders`.

Every vue component has injected `.$logger` object, to log something to console use `this.logger.log('Hello {}', {1:'world'})();` Note calling function again in the end. Logger is disabled for production. For more info visit [lines-logger](https://github.com/akoidan/lines-logger)

This project uses [vue-property-decorator](https://github.com/kaorun343/vue-property-decorator) (that's has a dependency [vue-class-component](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component)) [vuex-module-decorators](https://github.com/championswimmer/vuex-module-decorators). You should write your component as the following:

```typescript
import { Vue, Component, Prop, Watch, Emit, Ref } from 'vue-property-decorator'
import {userModule, State} from '@/utils/storeHolder'; // vuex module example


@Component
export class MyComp extends Vue {
  
  @Ref
  button: HTMLInputElement;

  @Prop readonly propA!: number;
  
  @State
  public readonly users!: User[];

  @Watch('child')
  onChildChanged(val: string, oldVal: string) { }

  @Emit() 
  changedProps() {}

  async created() {
    userModule.setUsers(await this.$api.getUsers());
  }
}
```

## Frontend config
development.json and production.json have the following format:
```json
{
  "BACKEND_ADDRESS": "e.g. pychat.org:443, protocol shouldn't be there, note there's no trailing slash, you can specify '{}' to use the same host as files served with",
  "IS_DEBUG": "set true for development and debug mode enabled",
